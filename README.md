Once you have the credentials, you can set the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables.  And theres also the need to set the `SITE_ID` environment variable to the site you want to use.

### Mercado Libre Site ID
- MLA: Argentina (default)
- MLB: Brasil
- MCO: Colombia
- MEX: M√©xico
- MLU: Uruguay
- MLC: Chile

}
```
#### Option 2: Local Installation

```

4. Add this configuration to your Claude Desktop config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mercadolibre-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/mercadolibre-mcp/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "CLIENT_ID": "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>",
        "CLIENT_SECRET": "<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>",
        "SITE_ID": "<YOUR_SITE_ID>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Debugging

Since MCP servers communicate over stdio, debugging can be challenging. We recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector), which is available as a package script:

```bash
npm run inspector
```

The Inspector will provide a URL to access debugging tools in your browser.
